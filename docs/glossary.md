## Event Sourcing Terminology

### Aggregate
A cluster of domain objects treated as a single unit for data changes. In event sourcing, aggregates are the primary entities that generate events.

### Command
A request for the system to perform an action. Commands are named in the imperative form (e.g., "CreateAccount", "DepositMoney").

### Event
An immutable record of something that happened in the system. Events are named in the past tense (e.g., "AccountCreated", "MoneyDeposited").

### Event Store
A specialized database designed to store events. Reactive Domain uses EventStoreDB as its event store.

### Event Stream
A sequence of events for a particular aggregate, ordered by version.

### Projection
A component that transforms events into queryable state. Projections are used to build read models.

### Read Model
A representation of data optimized for querying. Read models are built by projections from events.

### Snapshot
A point-in-time capture of an aggregate's state, used to optimize loading performance.

### Stream
In EventStoreDB, a stream is a named sequence of events. In Reactive Domain, each aggregate has its own stream.

## CQRS Terminology

### CQRS
Command Query Responsibility Segregation, a pattern that separates read and write operations.

### Command Side
The part of the system responsible for processing commands and generating events.

### Query Side
The part of the system responsible for handling queries and returning results.

### Command Handler
A component that processes commands and updates aggregates.

### Query Handler
A component that processes queries and returns results from read models.

## Domain-Driven Design Terminology

### Bounded Context
An explicit boundary within which a particular domain model applies.

### Domain Event
An event that represents something significant that happened in the domain.

### Entity
An object with a distinct identity that persists over time.

### Repository
A component that provides access to aggregates, abstracting the details of how they are stored and retrieved.

### Value Object
An object that represents a descriptive aspect of the domain with no conceptual identity.

## Reactive Programming Terminology

### Asynchronous
Operations that don't block the execution thread, allowing other operations to proceed.

### Event-Driven
A programming paradigm where the flow of the program is determined by events.

### Message
A data structure that is passed between components to communicate.

### Non-Blocking
Operations that don't halt the execution of the program while waiting for a result.

### Reactive
A programming paradigm that focuses on asynchronous data streams and the propagation of changes.

## Reactive Domain-Specific Terminology

### AggregateRoot
The base class for aggregates in Reactive Domain, providing common functionality for event sourcing.

### Correlation ID
An identifier that tracks a business transaction across multiple messages.

### Causation ID
An identifier that indicates which message caused the current message.

### EventRecorder
A component that records events generated by an aggregate.

### IEventSource
The core interface for event-sourced entities in Reactive Domain.

### IRepository
The interface for repositories in Reactive Domain, providing methods for loading and saving aggregates.

### ICorrelatedRepository
A repository that supports correlation and causation tracking.

### ISnapshotSource
An interface for entities that support snapshots.

### StreamNameBuilder
A component that generates consistent stream names for aggregates.

### StreamStoreConnection
A component that provides a connection to EventStoreDB.

### StreamStoreRepository
A repository implementation that stores and retrieves events from EventStoreDB.

## Related Concepts

### Idempotence
The property of certain operations in mathematics and computer science whereby they can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application.

### Eventual Consistency
A consistency model used in distributed computing to achieve high availability that informally guarantees that, if no new updates are made to a given data item, eventually all accesses to that item will return the last updated value.

### Optimistic Concurrency
A concurrency control method that assumes conflicts are rare and allows operations to proceed without locking, but checks for conflicts before committing changes.

### Temporal Query
A query that retrieves the state of the system at a specific point in time.

### Versioning
The process of assigning version numbers to unique states of a software or data structure.
