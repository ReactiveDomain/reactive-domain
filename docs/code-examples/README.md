# Reactive Domain Code Examples

[← Back to Table of Contents](../README.md)

This section provides practical code examples that demonstrate how to use Reactive Domain in real-world scenarios.

## Table of Contents

1. [Creating a New Aggregate Root](creating-aggregate-root.md)
2. [Handling Commands and Generating Events](handling-commands-events.md)
3. [Saving and Retrieving Aggregates](saving-retrieving-aggregates.md)
4. [Setting Up Event Listeners](event-listeners.md)
5. [Implementing Projections](implementing-projections.md)
6. [Handling Correlation and Causation](correlation-causation.md)
7. [Implementing Snapshots](implementing-snapshots.md)
8. [Testing Aggregates and Event Handlers](testing.md)
9. [Integration with ASP.NET Core](aspnet-integration.md)
10. [Complete Sample Applications](sample-applications.md)

Each example includes:

- Complete code snippets that you can copy and use in your own projects
- Explanations of key concepts and patterns
- Best practices and common pitfalls to avoid
- Variations for different use cases

## How to Use These Examples

The examples in this section are designed to be practical and reusable. You can:

1. Copy and paste the code into your own projects
2. Use them as templates for your own implementations
3. Adapt them to your specific requirements
4. Learn from them to understand how Reactive Domain works in practice

## Prerequisites

To run these examples, you'll need:

- .NET Core 3.1 or later
- EventStoreDB (for examples that use event storage)
- Basic understanding of event sourcing and CQRS concepts

## Getting Started

If you're new to Reactive Domain, we recommend starting with the [Creating a New Aggregate Root](creating-aggregate-root.md) example, followed by [Handling Commands and Generating Events](handling-commands-events.md) and [Saving and Retrieving Aggregates](saving-retrieving-aggregates.md).

For more advanced scenarios, check out the [Complete Sample Applications](sample-applications.md) section.
