# Reactive Domain

## Overview

Reactive Domain is an open source framework for implementing event sourcing in .NET projects using reactive programming principles. This includes interfaces for using [EventStoreDB](https://eventstore.com). It also provides a messaging framework and other tools for using CQRS.

The framework is highly opinionated. It focuses on using a small number of consistent patterns and design principles in its public interfaces to enable developers to get up to speed quickly. Ease of use and "design for code review" have been the driving forces behind the framework's evolution. Where trade-offs have been necessary, these principles have been emphasized over performance.
